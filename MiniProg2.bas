'Balance Work
'Work on Barchart is totally balance, it is a variant of Barchats in Miniporg1
'Challages are as follow:
   'Immediate Challenges
    '1. The code has been developed taking below 6 points limitation.
    '2. However the Code does not give proper output if the duration of activity is too long due to round of problem in interpolation in curved activity
    '3. Revise the
    '3. Remove the comment colon for printing debugging
    
   'Major Challenges
    '1. How to take care of moving CD
    '2 How to take care of project Start Date
    '3 How to take care of array output as per moving CD
    '4 Array output to be in line with the First Current date
    '5 While individual calculation to be as per project Start Date & to take care of Jump
    '6 All calculation in array of activity(), hard coded size for 3 years.
    


'This macro will should work for days, week, month & year in columns


'All the function and sub are related and the variable are interexhanged so take care
'Barchart function may work independed of other subs.
